Once upon a time, nestled in a field of tall green grass, lived a little firefly named Flicker. Flicker was a happy little bug, but he had a secret: Flicker was afraid of the dark.

Every evening, as the sun began to set and the world turned shades of purple and blue, Flicker would start to shiver. All the other fireflies would excitedly blink their lights, ready to dance and play in the night. But Flicker would hide under a big, green leaf, his own light stubbornly staying off.

"Oh, how I wish the night wasn't so… dark!" he'd whisper to himself.

One night, a wise old ladybug noticed Flicker hiding. She crawled over to him and said kindly, "Why aren't you shining tonight, little one?"

Flicker peeked out from under his leaf. "Because I'm scared of the dark," he confessed. "It's so big and… empty."

The wise ladybug smiled gently. "But Flicker," she said, "you are not empty. You have your own light inside you. The darkness isn't so scary when you have your own sparkle to guide you."

Flicker thought about this. He had never really thought about his own light before. He just knew the dark felt big and he felt small.

Taking a deep breath, Flicker slowly blinked his light on. It was a small, soft glow at first. He looked around. The darkness was still there, but now, there was also his light. It wasn't much, but it was his.

He blinked again, a little brighter this time. And then again, even brighter! He looked around and saw the other fireflies twinkling like tiny stars in the night. They didn't seem scared. They seemed happy.

Slowly, Flicker flew out from under his leaf. He still felt a little bit nervous, but his own light made him feel a little bit brave too. He flew closer to the other fireflies and blinked his light along with them.

The night didn't seem so big and empty anymore. It was filled with the gentle glow of hundreds of little lights, including his own. Flicker finally understood what the wise ladybug meant. He didn't need to be afraid of the dark because he carried his own sunshine within him.

From that night on, Flicker was no longer afraid of the dark. He became one of the brightest and happiest fireflies in the field, always ready to share his light with the world.
